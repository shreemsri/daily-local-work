<P><FONT SIZE="5">For an urbanite, there is nothing like the first breath of fresh hill air. As we drove from Guwahati towards Shillong the air just got cooler and better. True to its name 'abode of clouds' Meghalaya greeted us with a canopy of dense clouds. By the time we rolled into Shillong, it was already dusk and we headed straight to our hotel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="5">After an early morning delicious breakfast, we set out on a scenic ride to discover some wonderful gems of Meghalaya. Dotted with charming waterfalls, sublime hills and strange yet breathtaking natural wonders, the fascinating landscapes of Meghalaya kept me in awe of this place.</FONT></P>

<I><U>Double Decker Living Root Bridge</U></I></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>A little over 2 hours drive from Shillong, the single root bridge in Mawlynnong is an incredible feat of natural engineering.

<P>These astonishing structures are formed by interwoven pliable aerial roots of rubber trees. The native tribes of north-east India have mastered the art of growing such root bridges.</P>

<P>It wasn't merely like walking across another bridge. I felt absolutely elated to see this wonder of nature right in front of me, about which I had read a lot in books. This quaint bridge is one of the best places to visit in Meghalaya for nature enthusiasts.

<P>Spend some me-time basking in nature and enjoy the awe-striking beauty of the place. To avoid crowding, visitors are not allowed to stand on the bridge. Here is a small video clip of the living root bridge.</P>

<div class="main" bgcolour="#008000"  id="Umngot River"><H2><P><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="BLACK">
<I><U>Umngot River</U></I></FONT></H2>
<P>One of the most talked-about Indian rivers in social media, the Umngot river is known for its crystal clear waters. The river is so clean that it creates an illusion of boats floating in thin air.

<P>The river water becomes muddled during rains and you may not see the transparent view if travelling during monsoon.
<center><image src="https://wildlifezones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Umngot-river-1024x576.jpg" width="753" height="450"></center>
<P>It flows through the quaint town of Dawki and further into Bangladesh. Dawki is just 1-hour drive away from Mawlynnong and I managed to visit both places on the same day.

<P>One more point of interest near the Umngot river is Dawki suspension bridge, which was constructed during pre-independence days by Britishers.

<P>The entrancing beauty of this place makes it one of the unmissable places to visit in Meghalaya.

<div class="main" bgcolour="#FFFF00" id="Nohkalikai Falls"><H2><P><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="BLACK">
<I><U>Nohkalikai Falls</U></I></FONT></H2>
<P>The Nohkalikai Falls is at such a great height that by merely looking at it I felt a shiver go down my spine - of excitement mixed with some bit of trepidation. The sparkling plunge pool is equally impressive with its multi-hues of blue.

<P>I was fortunate to get clear views of the falls as the sky was almost clear after a brief rainfall.
<center><image src="https://wildlifezones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nohkalikai-Falls-1024x576.jpg" width="753" height="450"></center>
<P>Set at a height of 1115 ft and about 5 km away from Cherrapunjee town, it is the tallest plunge waterfall in India. The falls are fed by rainwater only. So, the best time to visit Nohkalikai falls is after monsoons when it looks most voluminous.</P>

<div class="main" id="Krang Suri Falls"><H2><P><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="BLACK">
<I><U>Krang Suri Falls</U></I></FONT></H2>
<P>A tranquil waterfall away from the common tourist circuit, Krang Suri falls is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Meghalaya where you can be at one with nature. Located in the peaceful town of Jowai, the falls is almost 3 hours drive from Shillong.
<center><image src="https://wildlifezones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Krang-Suri-Falls-in-Jowai-1024x576.jpg" width="753" height="450"></center>
<P>You have many things to do here - take a dip in the plunge pool, go boating or just sit on a rock beside the pool and enjoy the mesmerizing beauty this place has to offer.</P>

<I><U>Mawlynnong Village</U></I></FONT></H2>
<P>Famed as 'Asia’s Cleanest Village' Mawlynnong is known for cleanliness and eco-friendly ways of living. You can find bamboo garbage bins placed in every nook and corner of the village. The onus of keeping the village clean lies with the residents.
<center><image src="https://wildlifezones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mawlynnong-Village-1024x576.jpg" width="753" height="450"></center>
<P>Replete with greenery, Mawlynnong village is also referred to as "God's Own Garden". You can see a fenced blooming garden with colourful flowers in almost every home.

<P>Taking a stroll around the village, I came across this signboard welcoming visitors to God's Own Garden.
